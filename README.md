Call of Duty: Zombies style game in Unity

This game is a work in progress; I'm not entirely finished yet. I haven't added real zombies spawns (enemies spawn, but they do so in two spots I just placed by where the player is facing when the game starts), all of the weapons, having two weapons at a time, menus, melee, improved dismemberment, and multiplayer. 

Move - WSAD
Shoot - Left Mouse Button/Ctrl
Aim down sights - Right Mouse Button
Jump - Space
Reload - R
Sprint - Shift
Throw grenade - g (hold to cook, release to throw)
Use - F
