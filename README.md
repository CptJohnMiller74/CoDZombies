# CoDZombies
Call of Duty: Zombies style game in Unity

Demo video : https://youtu.be/ncgx9gaA-Fc

The player can jump, sprint, throw a grenade, shoot, reload, and get damaged by the zombies and die. Some of these actions cannot be done at the same time (i.e the player cannot sprint and shoot, sprint and reload, etc). Both the zombies' health and movement speed increase based on the current wave, and the amount of zombies in each wave increases as well. There are a few weapons in the game, each with their own properties such as recoil intensity, damage, fire rate, etc. The player earns points for damaging and killing the zombies, with headshots being worth double, and can spend those points on buying a different gun or refilling their ammo. 

This game is a work in progress; I'm not entirely finished yet. I haven't added real zombies spawns (enemies spawn, but they do so in two spots I just placed by where the player is facing when the game starts), all of the weapons, having two weapons at a time, menus, melee, improved dismemberment, upgrading weapons, and multiplayer.
