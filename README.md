Call of Duty: Zombies style game in Unity

Demo video : https://youtu.be/ncgx9gaA-Fc

This game is a work in progress; I'm not entirely finished yet. I haven't added real zombies spawns (enemies spawn, but they do so in two spots I just placed by where the player is facing when the game starts), all of the weapons, having two weapons at a time, menus, melee, improved dismemberment, upgrading weapons, and multiplayer. 

Move - WSAD <br />
Shoot - Left Mouse Button/Ctrl <br />
Aim down sights - Right Mouse Button <br />
Jump - Space <br />
Reload - R <br />
Sprint - Shift <br />
Throw grenade - g (hold to cook, release to throw) <br />
Use - F <br />
