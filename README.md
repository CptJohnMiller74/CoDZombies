# CoDZombies
Call of Duty: Zombies style game in Unity

Demo video : https://youtu.be/ncgx9gaA-Fc

The player can jump, sprint, throw a grenade, shoot, reload, and get damaged by the zombies and die. Some of these actions cannot be done at the same time (i.e the player cannot sprint and shoot, sprint and reload, etc). Both the zombies' health and movement speed increase based on the current wave, and the amount of zombies in each wave increases as well. The zombies spawn inside the buildings and if part of the spawn is destroyed, the playe can repair it. There are a few weapons in the game, each with their own properties such as recoil intensity, damage, fire rate, etc. When sprinting, because I didn't have an animation, the gun sways back and foth, and when rotating the camera, there is some sway as well. The player earns points for damaging and killing the zombies, with headshots being worth double, and can spend those points on buying a different gun or refilling their ammo. 

This game is a work in progress; I'm not entirely finished yet. I haven't added menus, melee, improved dismemberment, upgrading weapons, locked areas that need to be unlocked by spending points, and multiplayer.
